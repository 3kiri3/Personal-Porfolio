You must by all cost protect your sheeps from the wolves. You can move the shepherd using the arrow keys. The game is over when all the sheeps are dead. The game is pretty simple but it was a good way to learn the basics of Java."

I also added a social media aspect in my app to make it more attractive and maybe find your next garden partner !"
